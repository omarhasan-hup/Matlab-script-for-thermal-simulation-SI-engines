# Matlab-script-for-thermal-simulation-SI-engines
This Repo will contain a Matlab script for thermal simulation for the spark ignition engines with Several Graphs showing the relations between the crank angle and the following: in-cylinder-pressure , in-cylinder-temperature , instantanous mass drawen in cylinder, instantanous intake valve left, instantanous intake valve area, stroke volume, volumetric efficiency
Also, there will be a word doc called "Code description" it will contain a full description of all the script parts with an over view of all the code.
